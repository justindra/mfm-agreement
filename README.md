# MFM Agreement

This is a simple site built using [SST](https://sst.dev) and [Astro](https://astro.build). The idea is to keep track of the amount of effort that was spent by the fans vs the length of content that has been published by the hosts of the [My First Million](https://www.mfmpod.com/) podcast.

Features:

- Ping the YouTube API once a day to get the latest data on subscriber numbers and content lengths
- Show off who needs to uphold their side of the agreement on the site.

Site is deployed at [https://mfm.justindra.com](https://mfm.justindra.com).
